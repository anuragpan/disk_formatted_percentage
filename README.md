Project To calculate the persantage of the work done while formatting the hard drive.


objective: while we formate our hard drive with "quick format" box unchwcked then it takes hours to format meanwhile we are unable to see the persantage of disk formatted.
So this is the tool from which you can calculate the persantage of the disk formatted.


necessity: I want to know the amount of disk formatted(lol).
